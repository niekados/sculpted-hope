# Sculpted hope

Sculpted Hope is the website of a young artist who is progressing her hobby of pottery into her first business. For her little startup business, online presence is very important, as it is the most budget-friendly way of marketing and reaching a wider audience of like-minded people and customers. She wants to advertise her website on her business card, which she could hand out at art fairs, and promote her crafts through social media as well as friends and family. The artist would like to introduce herself and her works to visitors, allow them to purchase artworks they like, and invite them to join pottery classes at her small studio. 

## Strategy

Develop a static website for the artist to have an online presence. Build a platform to promote, showcase, and sell her artwork. Inform visitors about available pottery classes,  and allow them to locate her studio by having a local map and address. Have social media links and a contact form allowing users to communicate with an artist about her work, classes, shopping queries, and possible collaborations.

## Targeted Audience

Art lovers of any age, home improvers, people attending art fairs, anyone looking for unique presents, like-minded artists, art event organizers, people who are following up after receiving an artist's business card, and social media users.
