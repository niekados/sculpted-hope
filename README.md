# Sculpted hope

Sculpted Hope is the website of a young artist who is progressing her hobby of pottery into her first business. For her little startup business, online presence is very important, as it is the most budget-friendly way of marketing and reaching a wider audience of like-minded people and customers. She wants to advertise her website on her business card, which she could hand out at art fairs, and promote her crafts through social media as well as friends and family. The artist would like to introduce herself and her works to visitors, allow them to purchase artworks they like, and invite them to join pottery classes at her small studio. 

## Strategy

Develop a static website for the artist to have an online presence. Build a platform to promote, showcase, and sell her artwork. Inform visitors about available pottery classes,  and allow them to locate her studio by having a local map and address. Have social media links and a contact form allowing users to communicate with an artist about her work, classes, shopping queries, and possible collaborations.

## Targeted Audience

Art lovers of any age, home improvers, people attending art fairs, anyone looking for unique presents, like-minded artists, art event organizers, people who are following up after receiving an artist's business card, and social media users.

## User Stories

New users would like to:

- Find out more about the artist
- Explore her artworks
- Purchase artwork 
- Find information about available pottery classes 
- Contact the artist 
- Follow the artist on social media

Returning users would like to:

- Purchase artworks
- Check the days and times of pottery classes
- Find the address of her pottery studio before attending her classes
- Get in touch with an artist
- Check again the social links of an artist

## Scope

This project has budget limitations and to keep the lowest costs possible the website will be static, keeping development and maintenance expenses minimal. The artist would like to introduce herself to the users and a welcoming message on the first visit would fulfil the requirement, it would also give a personal touch and build a relationship with the visitor.  

Selling artwork is as important as building relations with users, for this reason, we will implement a web store page/section to list artworks available for purchase. The items in the store will be linked to the artist's Etsy store, further simplifying and reducing the costs of payment system management.

As an artist also runs pottery workshops, we will have a section/page with information about classes, to let the users know of available times and dates. Including a map will allow users to easily find the location of the studio if they decide to attend workshops.

Easy communication is an important part of the project and there will be a contact form available on the website, as well as social media links, allowing visitors to be in touch with the artist.

All pages will have images reflecting the theme of the section the user is currently visiting. Shop stores will have individual images for each store item. 

## Structure

The website will have 4 pages. Home page, Shop page, Workshops page, and Contact page. 

### Navigation

Page navigation- linear, with the same appearance on all the pages. Depending on your location on the site, the corresponding page name will be highlighted in the nav bar. The Navigation bar will be placed on top of the screen for easy and intuitive access. For mobile devices, it will collapse into a hamburger menu. For larger screens, it will be displayed in one line without the collapsed menu.
